#
# Phockup configuration file
#
# This file is intended to provide a place to configure most command line options
# in a single place for simplifying consistent behavior in different environments
# and with particular file sets.
#
# By default, phockup will look for a configuration file in the same directory
# named phockup.yaml.  You can override the configuration file used by passing
# it on the command line via the --config option.
#
# Any option that is supported on the command line work here if you use the 'long
# name for the option (i.e. 'date_field' instead of 'f').  The hyphens must be
# converted to underscores (e.g. 'date-field' -> 'date_field') due to a difference
# in convention between command line arguments and python variable naming.
